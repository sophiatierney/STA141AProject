# Data Science Fundamentals - Binary Classification Group Project

Data analysis on data from a Portugese bank's marketing campaign. The goal was to predict which clients would sign a long term deposit based off consumer behaivor from the previous year's campaign. Utilized machine learning algorithms for classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Deep Learning), and compared models by how well they performed on the imbalanced minority class. 

The dataset used has been provided in the 'bank-additional-full.csv' file, containing 41188 samples and 20 features.

Other versions of the bank dataset can be found on UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
